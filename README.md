In this lab:

Please feel free to run the functions. The import 'sleep' brings in a function that 
simply delays the execution of the functions by a portion of a second. This allows
us to see how fast or slow a function will actually execute. Comment the function 
calls out at the bottom towards the bottom of the document and compare the smaller 
data sets to the larger ones for each type of function. Feel free to experiment with
longer lists as well (just add elements to the lists passed in to each function).
